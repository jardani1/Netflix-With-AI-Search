# Netflix GPT

I developed Netflix-GPT Built In React Js, leveraging OpenAI for interactive movie suggestions. Users can log in via Firebase, access features such as movie details, and have created a huge redux-store for allover state management.

# Use a VPN As the TMDB Movie Api doesnt work in india but working on some of the ISP instead of jio

## Setup

- Install react app using create-react-app (CRA)

```js
npx create-react-app netflix-gpt
```

- Create `.env` file and put configure

```js
REACT_APP_BASE_URL = YOUR_APPLICATION_BASE_URL; // http://localhost:300
REACT_APP_OPENAI_KEY = YOUR_API_KEY_WILL_HERE;
REACT_APP_TMDB_KEY = YOUR_API_KEY_WILL_HERE;
```

- Install and init tailwind css

```js
npm install -D tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init
```

- Configure tailwind css in your project

  `npx tailwindcss init` command will create a file `tailwind.config.js` in your project's root directory.
  Open `tailwind.config.js` and replace all content with below code.

```js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

- Add the @tailwind directives for each of Tailwindâ€™s layers to your ./src/index.css file.

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

- Now you created a react app with tailwind css successfully. Now run the below command on your terminal to start your local development server.

```js
npm start
```
